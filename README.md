Object-Oriented Design Patterns

A course in software design using design patterns as a tool for communicating software design solutions and as an aid in software refactoring. Creational, structural and behavioral patterns are emphasized. Also covered are finding and documenting software development patterns. The Unified Modeling Language is used as the design tool for software patterns and programming projects are in an object-oriented programming language.
